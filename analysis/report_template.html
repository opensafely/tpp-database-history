    <h1>OpenSAFELY-TPP Database Historical Coverage</h1>
    <p>
        This report displays the historical coverage of the OpenSAFELY-TPP database.
        It is part of the OpenSAFELY platform's technical documentation
        and is published at <a href="https://reports.opensafely.org/">https://reports.opensafely.org/</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you would like to use the OpenSAFELY platform, then you should read
        our <a href="https://docs.opensafely.org/">documentation</a>,
        our <a href="https://www.opensafely.org/about/">principles</a>,
        and our process for <a href="https://www.opensafely.org/onboarding-new-users/">onboarding new users</a>.

    <h2>Data Sources</h2>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://reports.opensafely.org/reports/opensafely-tpp-database-schema/"><em>OpenSAFELY-TPP Database Schema</em></a>
        report contains information about the data sources in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database.
    </p>
    <h2>Report Run Date</h2>
    <p>
        This report was run on {{ to_date|date_format }}.
        It reflects the state of the database on this date.
    </p>
    <h2>Event Activity</h2>
    <p>
        In the figures below,
        <em>event activity</em> (counts of events, such as in-patient hospital admissions)
        is reported for data sources from {{ from_date|date_format }} to {{ to_date|date_format }}.
    </p>
    <p>
        The database only includes patients who were registered at GP practices using TPP's SystmOne clinical information system
        (which is used by roughly 40% of GP practices)
        on or after {{ tpp_epoch_date|date_format }},
        including those patients who have since deregistered or died.
        The database therefore captures event activity for these patients only.
